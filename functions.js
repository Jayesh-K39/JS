function func(x,y){
	return 1 + ((x+y)/2)
}

// Functions can be made without passing arguments as well. Like this:

function hello(){
	console.log('Hi, Jayu!')
}


hello()


// A function that doesn't return anything (like the void function in C) can also be made. The above hello function is also an example of that....
