// While Loops check the condition first. If the condition is satisfied, the loop body is executed.

//Do while execute the loop body first, no matter th conditions are met or not. Then, from the second iteration, they check teh conditions. If those are met, they execute the loop body again, else they stop (or do whatever is supposed to be done)
