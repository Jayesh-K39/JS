/*
Window object represents browser window abd provides methods to control it.
It is a global object.
Every element is a window element. We can write window.console.log() as well (and all the other methods too.)
Won't work here in terminal, but will work in the browser. 





DOM = Document Object Model: Reresents the page content on HTML
document body = page body as Javascript object 


document.body.style.background = 'yellow'- this wont work here. Only in the browsers.

document is not a specific html file that we create. 
It's actually the page we currently are on.

So, create a HTMl file with any name and if you write JS commands in console, it will work just fine.

BOM = Browser Object Model: Represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.
The functions alert, confirm, prompt are also a part of the BOM
